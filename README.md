# RDL Report

This is a (very limited) Javascript report system that uses the RDL report definition file.

The RDL report definition file is used by the ASP reporting system and is being phased out in favor of reporting at the SQL level and other reporting tools. 
However, there are some systems that still use it.

This first version supports putting a background image (a government form) on the page and filling in fields on that form with data from the host.
